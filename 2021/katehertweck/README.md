Other resources mentioned in the presentation are listed and annotated below. 

The work that I do at [Fred Hutch Cancer Research Center](https://www.fredhutch.org) includes:
- [fredhutch.io](http://www.fredhutch.io): a training program for data and computational analyses for biomedical researchers at Fred Hutch
- [The Coop](http://thecoop.fredhutch.org): Fred Hutch Bioinformatics and Data Science Cooperative, which builds community and shares knowledge around data-intensive research among staff, affiliates, and collaborators
- [Biomedical Data Science Wiki](https://sciwiki.fredhutch.org): curated collection of documentation about data generation and computing at Fred Hutch
- [Data analysis as a package template](https://github.com/FredHutch/VISCtemplates) from the [Vaccine Immunology Statistical Center (VISC)](https://www.fredhutch.org/en/research/divisions/vaccine-infectious-disease-division/research/biostatistics-bioinformatics-and-epidemiology/statistical-center-for-hiv-aids-research-and-prevention.html) at Fred Hutch
- ["From novice to expert: Supporting all levels of computational expertise in reproducible research methods"](https://www.dropbox.com/s/fyyos9yiju4l5cv/2020HertweckStrasserPEARC.pdf?dl=0), Hertweck and Strasser, 2020, Practice and Experience in Advanced Research Computing (PEARC â€™20).

Groups that train people to work with specialized audiences: 
- [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org) teaches foundational coding and data science skills to researchers worldwide.
- [Metadocencia](https://metadocencia.netlify.app) supports Spanish-speaking educators in adopting evidence-based, student-centered educational methods, and are currently developing computational training materials.
